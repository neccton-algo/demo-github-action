# Github action

* Continuous integration to test your code on every commit, pull request
* Possibly on multiple platforms (Ubuntu, Mac OS, Windows...) and different versions of julia/python/...
* All these combinations represent the test matrix
* However, even if GitHub action is free for open source projects, consider the environmental impact and avoid unnecessary combinations of OS/version/...
